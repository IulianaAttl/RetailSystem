## Description

This project represents a development cycle using Agile SCRUM methods, including a Scrum Sprint. Each step in the development process is completed in sequence using the appropriate tools and recorded via screenshots and deliverables in our team report. Our team worked together adhering to the principles and values of Scrum and nominated a SCRUM Master. In BrightSpace, we worked together via the Bongo video assignment tool. The Bongo video assignment tool is an innovative, video-based assessment tool. This tool creates a collaborative learning space where students in each group could complete group activities, communicate and meet virtually, jointly 
present synchronously and asynchronously, and evaluate their peers.

It is a system for a retail outlet to add, manage and delete stock items and to purchase items using a shopping basket to be used by customers. It also features two tools for employees: a change calculator to give the correct change for a purchase and an item packer that minimizes boxes used to pack items by comparing dimensions and weight limits.

## Tools used during this process:
- GitHub: Code repository
- JIRA: Agile SCRUM project management tool
- Bongo Video Assignment Tool: Collaboration, communication and submission tool.
