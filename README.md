## Description

This project represents a development cycle using Agile SCRUM methods, including a Scrum Sprint. Each step in the development process is completed in sequence using the appropriate tools and recorded via screenshots and deliverables in our team report. Our team worked together adhering to the principles and values of Scrum and nominated a SCRUM Master. In BrightSpace, we worked together via the Bongo video assignment tool. The Bongo video assignment tool is an innovative, video-based assessment tool. This tool creates a collaborative learning space where students in each group could complete group activities, communicate and meet virtually, jointly 
present synchronously and asynchronously, and evaluate their peers.

## Tools used during this process:
- GitHub: Code repository
- JIRA: Agile SCRUM project management tool
- Bongo Video Assignment Tool: Collaboration, communication and submission tool.
